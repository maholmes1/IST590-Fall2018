1. Saving the kenny.png file as a .txt file (?) revealed a group of letters at the end of the file which you will be familiar with if you 
are a "South Park" fan. This is how Kenny in "South Park" "talks": unintelligibly, through his scarf. There is a website that will trans-
late these utterances into "Kennyspeak." Copying and pasting the last line of the file yielded the word "dissolve."

2. The author of this article lost his coveted Twitter handle because GoDaddy allowed verification using the last four digits of the user's
credit card number, which allowed a hacker to use social engineering to impersonate him and gain control of his GoDaddy account, which
allowed him to break into the author's Facebook account and hold them hostage until the Twitter handle was turned over.
